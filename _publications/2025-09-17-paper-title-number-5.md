### Abstract
<div class="justify-text">
Over the past several decades, silicon has maintained its position as a major focus of the semiconductor industry [1-2]. However, in recent years, wide bandgap semiconductors such as silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) offer superior performance compared to silicon-based semiconductors, owing to their high breakdown field and electron saturation velocity, making them ideal for operation in high-frequency and high-power conditions [3]. SiC substrates are frequently employed in AlGaN/GaN high electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs). The lattice constant and thermal expansion coefficient of SiC closely match those of GaN, minimizing stress during the growth process and improving the device's performance and reliability [4]. 
Despite these advantages offered by SiC, the power industry still demands high-frequency performance and operational reliability in high-power applications, which is why the introduction of a field plate in AlGaN/GaN HEMTs aims to enhance the device's operational reliability in these conditions. However, the addition of a field plate inevitably increases the device capacitance, which directly degrades RF performance. Fig. 1 shows the cut-off frequency (f<sub>T</sub>), and parasitic gate-to-source capacitance (C<sub>gs</sub>) with and without field plate structure. Results indicate that the introduction of the field plate leads to an increase in parasitic capacitance, which results in a reduction of f<sub>T</sub> by 23.26%. Therefore, it is crucial to optimize the field plate configuration to improve RF performance while minimizing the reduction in the device’s breakdown voltage (V<sub>BD</sub>).
In this study, we systematically investigate the impact of top field plate length (L<sub>TFP</sub>) on both electrical characteristics and transient responses of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs using technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulation. Fig. 2 illustrates the field plate configurations in AlGaN/GaN HEMT device. To assess the effect of L<sub>TFP</sub>, we first compare the f<sub>T</sub> and C<sub>gs</sub> and analyze how these variations affect the RF characteristics. Then, simulations are conducted to investigate the V<sub>BD</sub> and transient responses. Finally, we propose the optimal top field plate configuration considering Johnson’s figure-of-merit (J<sub>FOM</sub>), which can be expressed as J<sub>FOM</sub> = V<sub>BD</sub> × f<sub>T</sub>, and the transient responses. 
As a result, we propose valuable insights for optimizing top field plate design to balance electrical performance and reliability, thus contributing to the advancement of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs for high-frequency and power electronic systems.
