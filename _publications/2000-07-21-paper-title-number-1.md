### Abstract
<div class="justify-text">
This study presents an air gap gate with AlN passivation to enhance RF performance of AlGaN/GaN high-electron-mobility transistors(HEMTs) while addressing thermal challenges. The air gap gate is known to improve RF performance by reducing gate capacitance. However, other effects on the device have not been investigated. Therefore, we examine changes in device characteristics induced by the air gap gate. Compared to a baseline with a 0.15μm planar gate, cutoff frequency improves by 23.9%, reaching 35.82GHz. Moreover, saturation drain current and maximum transconductance of the air gap gate increase. Even when considering that DC characteristics change, thermal performance degrades due to reduced heat dissipation, as evidenced by elevated operating temperature, increased thermal resistance, and pronounced temperature gradients in the device. To overcome these thermal drawbacks, high thermal conductivity AlN passivation is incorporated into the air gap gate. This approach offers significant improvement in thermal management. Furthermore, the air gap gate with AlN passivation still exhibits a 17.5% increase in cutoff frequency relative to the baseline with Si3N4 passivation. DC characteristics of the air gap gate are maintained as well. These findings suggest that the air gap gate with AlN passivation provides a reliable solution for AlGaN/GaN HEMTs, thereby enhancing device operational reliability in high-frequency and high-temperature conditions.
