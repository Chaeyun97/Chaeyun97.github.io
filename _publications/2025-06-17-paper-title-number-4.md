### Abstract
<div class="justify-text">
This study explored the influence of acceptor trap diffusion lengths within the GaN buffer on the DC characteristics and current collapse behavior of AlGaN/GaN
 HEMT using TCAD simulation. As the acceptor trap diffusion length increased, the ionized acceptor trap density near the AlGaN/GaN interface also rose, which
 led to an upward shift in the conduction band in the GaN buffer and secured a confinement of the electron within the channel. Consequently, the electrical
 characteristics such as threshold voltage, drain current, maximum transconductance were significantly influenced by the variation in the acceptor trap diffusion
 lengths. Additionally, the conduction band slope of the AlGaN barrier became more gradual, which reduced the probability of electron tunneling and gate leakage
 current. Also, an increase in acceptor trap diffusion length reduced the difference between ionized acceptor trap densities in the GaN buffer before and after stress
 pulse, thereby leading to a smaller 2-DEG variation and mitigation of current collapse. These findings indicate that the diffusion length in the GaN buffer is a key
 factor influencing both the DC characteristics and current collapse of the AlGaN/GaN HEMT.
