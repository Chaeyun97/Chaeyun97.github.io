### Abstract
<div class="justify-text">
This study investigates the thermal and DC characteristics of single-finger, two-finger, and fourfinger AlGaN/GaN high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) by considering the self-heating
effect and thermal crosstalk, which arise in multi-finger HEMTs degrading the device performance.
As the number of fingers increases, the maximum channel lattice temperature of the device
increases due to the thermal crosstalk between gate fingers, leading to decreased maximum drain
current. To investigate electrical operational degradation caused by thermal crosstalk in multifinger HEMTs, we first compare the distribution of channel lattice temperatures across the multiple
fingers and analyze how this affects their DC characteristics. Then, we simulate the time-dependent
global device temperature of the three structures with transient thermal analysis to define device
operation stability. To overcome the deteriorated thermal characteristics and DC performances of
the four-finger HEMTs, we propose a multi-finger design to mitigate thermal crosstalk by
modulating the centrally located source contact length to distribute the heat effectively. This design
increases the distance between the second and third gate fingers, where the most dominant
crosstalk occurs, demonstrating the potential for enhanced thermal stability in devices using this
new configuration. These comprehensive insights into four-finger HEMTs, addressing both
thermal behavior and degradation mechanisms, offer promising solutions to overcome the
reliability and performance challenges posed by thermal effects in AlGaN/GaN HEMTs and other
power devices.
