Welcome! I'm Chaeyun Lim, a researcher at Dongguk University interested in RF/mmWave Devices, GaN HEMTs.

This website is where I share my research publications, academic presentations, and professional activities.  
I am currently working on advanced modeling and simulation of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs using Silvaco TCAD, with focus on RF performance optimization and thermal management.
